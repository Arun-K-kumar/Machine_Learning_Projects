# 🏠 House Price Prediction Project

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting house prices based on a variety of housing features using regression algorithms.

---

## 📘 Overview

The notebook `House_price_prediction.ipynb` walks through the end-to-end process of:
- Loading and exploring housing data
- Preprocessing and cleaning the dataset
- Visualizing relationships between variables
- Building and evaluating machine learning models

---

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning models and evaluation
- **XGBoost** – gradient boosting model (optional)
- **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive analysis

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes features such as:
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Living area square footage
- Lot size
- Number of floors
- Waterfront, view, condition, grade
- Year built or renovated
- Geographic location (zipcode, latitude, longitude)

*Ensure you have the dataset available locally or update the notebook to match your path.*

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch the notebook**  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook House_price_prediction.ipynb
   ```

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Regression models are evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

The notebook compares multiple regression models to select the one with the best performance.

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Add hyperparameter tuning
- Implement cross-validation
- Build a web-based front end using Flask or Streamlit
- Deploy the model using Docker or a cloud platform
